# PRD Generation Assistant

This Claude Code assistant helps you create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for MVP development projects.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a `docs` folder in your project root
2. The assistant will generate a `PRD.md` file with detailed product specifications
3. All PRDs will be generated in Korean for better localization

## Usage

Run this command to generate a PRD:

```bash
claude-code "Please create a docs folder and generate a comprehensive PRD.md file. I'll provide the following project information:

Project Name: [Enter your project name]
Project Description: [Enter the core problem you're solving and your solution]
Target Users: [B2B/B2C/Both] - [Detailed user description]
Domain/Industry: [Application field]

Please ask me for these details and then create a detailed PRD in Korean using the comprehensive template below."
```

## PRD Template

You are a product management expert. Based on the project information provided, create a comprehensive PRD for an MVP that can be completed within 3 months.

### Tech Stack (Fixed)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), shadcn/ui, TailwindCSS, Lucide Icons
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Database, Realtime, Storage)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Development**: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier

### Development Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 12 weeks (3 months)
- **Team Assumption**: 1-2 full-stack developers

- **Who will use this product?** (Target Audience)  
- **What value does it provide?** (Value Proposition)
- **What differentiates it from competitors?** (Unique Selling Points)

### 2. Core Features Definition (3-5 features)
For each feature, use this detailed template:

```markdown
## Feature [Number]: [Feature Name]

### Overview
- **Purpose**: [Problem this feature solves]
- **Priority**: P0(Essential)/P1(Important)/P2(Optional)
- **Estimated Development Time**: [Days/Weeks]

### 3. Data Architecture
```typescript
// Drizzle ORM schema examples
// Table definitions for each core feature
// Relationship setup and indexing strategy
// Supabase RLS policies
```

### 4. User Flow Diagrams
```
[Start] ‚Üí [Step1] ‚Üí [Step2] ‚Üí ... ‚Üí [Complete]
   ‚Üì         ‚Üì
[Exception] [Alternative Path]
